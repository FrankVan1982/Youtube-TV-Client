# Installation

Microsoft Store. The package is under verification and has not been approved yet, I will post a link here when published.

# Usage
Use it as you would use YouTube TV. Use the arrows on your keyboard to navigate across the whole interface, and use <kbd>Enter</kbd> as the Ok button.

Navigation can also be done with the mouse cursor and scroll wheel, but it is trickier.

You can also link YouTube TV to your phone as if it was a regular TV app, and then cast videos to it.

When searching for videos, typing with your keyboard will work, but note that **pressing the enter key will type the selected character**. Results are loaded automatically, you just need to scroll down in order to see them.

# FAQ
**Q: Maximum resolution is limited to a lower resulution**<br>
A: The maximum resolution will be determined by the window size on launch, therefore, by your device's screen resolution.

**Q: YouTube TV has different languages, but this application shows in english only.**<br>
You can change the language on the in-app preferences.
